# Reinforcement-learing-for-Solar-flare-prediction
This code is PyTorch implementation of reinforcement learning, DQN an dDouble DQN, to forecast >=M class solar flare 24 hours prediction.

This code has used for the paper "Application of deep reinforcement learning to major solar flare forecast" (accepted, 2023, ApJS).
